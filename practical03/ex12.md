## Named Pipes

- With named pipes, information can be shared between any processes. A FIFO is unidirectional, which means we would need to open two pipes, one to send from A to B the color information and another one to send the response from B to A.

## Normal Pipes

- With normal pipes communication can only be done between children and parents, so the only way information about the colour could be sent is with co-processes,where the parent sends the color to the stdin of the child process, and it responds through the stdout.

## Signals

- Information cannot be sent.
- We could although use different signals to that would mean different colors, since we have a very limited set of colors (7), while having an array of colors in each process.
