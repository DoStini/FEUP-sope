## Overload
- While the first client is going to the chair he chose, the second can choose the same chair as the previous one because the first one didn't reach it yet.

## Deadlock

- The client verifies and goes to the chair to sleep
- The barber finishes and verifies the waiting room, but the new client didn't reach the chair yet, so both sleep.
