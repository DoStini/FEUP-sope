## Deadlock
- Everyone picks up the left fork, they will be waiting forever

## Sarvation
- If one phylosopher was thinking very fast, he could put down and pickup the fork so fast the right process didn't have time to pick up, hence the second process will starve

## Livelock
- Every process is running, but noone is eating
- If put fork gives up and tries again in 5 minutes. (timeout)
- The processes are running and always running, however noone is reaching the critical zone
