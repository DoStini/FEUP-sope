## Linux

- Linux doesn't need file extensions to know how to open/run some file. However, it's a convetion to name the file with extensions to more easily manipulate files, for example, deleting all .txt files. If all of text files were using this extension, a simple `rm *.txt` would work, instead of checking which of the files were text and which ones are not. However, each linux desktop environment might use file extensions to decide what program to open

## Windows

- Windows, on contrary, stores the file extension in the file properties and uses it all the time to know how to run/open the file. Because of this, windows can hide the extension from the file's name, because the extension is stored in the file's properties.
