# Name

Identifies the file. Useful to know what file we're handling/want to handle, and for search mechanisms.

# Attributes

File attributes are a type of meta-data that describe and may modify how files and/or directories in a filesystem behave. Typical file attributes may, for example, indicate or specify whether a file is visible, modifiable, compressed, or encrypted.

# Modes

Define the way a given file is to be handled with. For example, a text file may be used for reading, for writing or for both, each of them representing a specific mode.

# Permissions

It defines who can use and access a given file. Files have a owner permission, group permission and a other permission. The file has a defined permission mode for each of them, which will tell who can and how they can access the file.
